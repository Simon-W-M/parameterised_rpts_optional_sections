# parameterised_rpts_optional_sections
This is a simple repo to show parameterised markdown reports with sections that can be optional in each report


This uses NHSR datasets to pull in some dummy data.

It then uses a run file to trigger a simple markdown report that sits within a loop that is fed parameters.

The more advanced version takes that and then adds sections that can be turned on and off in each report.  

Thus allowing a basic report to be created but still with a bit of localised customisation.
